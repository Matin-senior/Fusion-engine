# 🚀 Fusion Engine

Effortless, Intelligent React Project Merging — No Matter How Different They Are

---


## What is Fusion Engine?

Fusion Engine is a tool for those who quietly build the impossible.  
No drama, no buzzwords. Just pure engineering, quietly merging React codebases that were never meant to meet.

No matter how different two projects are—structure, naming, or even styling—Fusion Engine analyzes, understands, and fuses them into one coherent project.

---

## Status: Work in Progress

If you’re reading this, the engine is still being forged.  
The real magic is happening behind the curtain:  
Late nights, wild ideas, and a commitment to building something that just… works.

---

## Why?

Merging two (or more) React projects is a nightmare.  
Different folder structures, conflicting file names, custom configs, routes tangled everywhere.  
No tool really understands what’s going on.

Fusion Engine isn’t about copy-paste.  
It’s about reading the mind of your codebase—AST, import graphs, file roles, context.  
It learns, it adapts, it merges.  
You just watch the magic happen.

## Core Features (in development)

- AST & Import Graph Analysis  
  Reads the code, not just the file names. Understands what every file really is.
- Role Inference  
  Figures out what’s a route, a component, a utility, a style, and more.
- Intelligent Merging  
  Merges similar files, resolves conflicts, and warns you before anything breaks.
- Interactive UI (coming soon)  
  Add projects, tweak how they merge, drag & drop structure, preview everything.
- Plugin Support  
  Extend with custom rules, support for Next.js, Remix, Tailwind, you name it.
- Memory for Roles  
  Remembers what it learns for next time.  
- Clear Reports  
  See what was merged, changed, and why.

## How Does It Work?

1. You add two (or more) React projects.
2. Fusion Engine analyzes everything:  
   AST, import trees, configs, file contents.
3. You control the merge:  
   Use a UI to set priorities, exclude files, drag pieces around, or just trust the engine.
4. Get a clean, intelligent fusion:  
   One project. All the best parts.  
   A detailed report to show what happened.

## Who Is This For?

- Anyone who’s ever tried to merge two large React projects and wondered,  
  “Why isn’t there a tool for this?”
- Devs who want to refactor, modernize, or build fast by remixing existing work.
- Dreamers who like tools that feel like magic, not manual labor.

Sometimes the best tools are built quietly,  
and speak for themselves when you use them.  
Fusion Engine is one of those.

> Stay tuned.  
> The future of merging is silent, smart, and surprisingly beautiful.
